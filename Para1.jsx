        Passion is when you put more energy into something youâ€™ve always had a
        thing for. It is more than just enthusiasm or excitement, passion is
        ambition that is materialized into action to put as much heart, mind,
        body and soul into something as is possible. It is the key to pursue the
        mightiest heights of capabilities and achievements one wants to acquire.
