        The bewitching power of your dream that enables you to do something
        charismatic and alluring and brings out the inner power that you never
        knew existed. A dream gives us hope for the future, and it also brings
        us power in the present. It makes it possible for us to prioritize
        everything we do. A person who has a dream knows what he is willing to
        leave for climbing up the ladder of success.
