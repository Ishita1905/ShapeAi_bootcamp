        Passion can be nurtured and learned. Yes, it is possible. So if you have
        not found something you are passionate about, just follow your curiosity
        and find things that make you blissful. It is all about self-discovery,
        where you will have to dive into your inner self and explore your
        deepest needs. Something virtuous about passion is it gives wings to
        your desires and longings.
